# Portfolio_v2 reactdev.io

This portfolio was built to showcase my resume and projects I have worked on. Later, I will add a blog to my portfolio, to help people learn React.
It was built using React (Next.js), TypeScript, Styled Components and GraphQL.

## Run locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Refactoring of the code

- [ ] Create seperate styles.ts files for the styled components
- [ ] Don't use props everywhere in the css styling, change to theme object
- [ ] Write unit tests for the components with Jest

## New features

- [ ] Add blog to the portfolio, for React articles
- [ ] Redesign the project detail page
